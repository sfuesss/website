                <h4>SFU Course Navigator</h4>
                <p>The unoffical SFU course navigator is the best course planning tool available for engineering
                    students.
                    Using it is simple and intuitive. Start by choosing any engineering option - this will load the
                    "recommended" schedule for that
                    option. Need to modify the recommended schedule? No problem, the application is fully
                    dynamic, meaning that you can drag and drop courses into a different term, add additional
                    years/terms to your schedule,
                    add additional courses to the schedule, and much more. Worried that your schedule might not meet
                    degree requirements?
                    The course navigators automatic error detection has you covered. The navigator tests your schedule
                    by checking term availabilty
                    of each course, pre-requisites, and degree requirements specific to the option you chose. When
                    you're all done, you can save the schedule and load it up the next time you use the app.

            <p class="desc">Many students run into issues during course enrolment and have questions about who to
                contact to get them resolved. We have compiled a curated list of questions and answers to address the
                most common problems.</p>
            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <ul class="faq-container">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Q: My required courses conflict?</strong></li>
                    <li>A: Email the undergraduate assistant (enscugra@sfu.ca) and explain your issue. They may be able
                        to reschedule a course. You must request this before course enrollment begins, or it may be too
                        late. These must be courses the department intends for you to take together. Alternatively, you
                        can submit a time-conflict request <a
                            href="https://coursys.sfu.ca/forms/ensc-time-conflict-request-form/"
                            target="_blank">form</a> and enroll in both conflicting courses. The department will expect
                        you to have a plan to minimize the consequences of the conflict.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Q: My required course is full, and I can’t waitlist?</strong></li>
                    <li>A: Email the undergraduate assistant (enscugra@sfu.ca) and explain your issue. They may be able
                        to add more seats.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Q: I can’t enroll in courses from another department?</strong></li>
                    <li>A: The other department probably reserves those seats for students in their program. You can
                        enroll during open enrollment. Alternatively, you can declare a minor in the other department to
                        gain immediate enrollment privileges. Computer engineering students commonly declare a CMPT
                        minor</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Q: This is my first time enrolling in an upper-division course, and my enrollment was
                            not processed?</strong></li>
                    <li>A: You must declare your concentration before enrolling in upper division courses. Please fill
                        out this <a href="https://coursys.sfu.ca/forms/ensc-declare-ensc-option/"
                            target="_blank">form</a>, and the undergraduate assistant will process it promptly. You may
                        enroll in upper division courses after the form is approved.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Q: I want to take an elective, but it's not pre-approved?</strong></li>
                    <li>A: Submit a course substitution <a
                            href="https://coursys.sfu.ca/forms/ensc-course-substitutionswaivers/"
                            target="_blank">waiver</a>. The undergraduate assistant and UCC chair will assess the
                        course. Approval will depend on the course's accreditation status, academic unit distribution,
                        and your personal circumstances.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Q: I’m missing a pre-requisite, but I took an equivalent course?</strong></li>
                    <li>A: This is generally acceptable. Submit a course substitution <a
                            href="https://coursys.sfu.ca/forms/ensc-course-substitutionswaivers/"

                    <li>A: This is allowed if your supervisor approves. After getting written consent from your
                        supervisor, submit a time-conflict request <a
                            href="https://coursys.sfu.ca/forms/ensc-time-conflict-request-form/"

                As much as we would all love to simply snap our fingers and change our transcripts to have all perfect
                grades,
                we can't. The good news is you can still stand out by having an impressive resume and cover letter. Not
                sure how to
                design/format your resume and cover letters? Take a look at the SFU OLC's <a
                    href="https://olc.sfu.ca/gallery/resume" target="_blank">resume</a>
                and <a href="https://olc.sfu.ca/gallery/cover-letter" target="_blank">cover
                    letter</a> galleries for some inspiration. Still feeling a bit stuck?
                follow <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/students/career/looking-for-work/resume-coverletter.html"
                    target="_blank">SFU's guide and checklist</a> for making a resume and cover letter from start to
                finish.
                In addition to a strong resume and cover letter, you will greatly increase your chances of being hired
                if you have either relevant work experience or relevant personal projects for the position your
                applying to. While many of us do not have relevant work experience, personal projects are something that
                anyone can do. They show that you are passionate
                and have demonstrated at least some of the skills they are looking for in a co-op student.

            <p class="desc">The Engineering Science Student Society is a Department Student Union (DSU) whose
                mission
                is to foster the academic, personal, and professional goals of our students. We strive to improve
                education
                quality in conjunction with the School of Engineering, promote engineering as a profession, develop
                an
                interest in extra-curricular activities, and encourage school spirit. We provide services and
                materials
                to
                help students succeed in their educational endeavours. We host a variety of events each term that
                help
                students
                interact with their peers, build new connections, and enhance their network.

                the SFSS, Engineering Science Administration and University Administration, communicate between
                graduate
                and
                undergraduate students, plan social events, and support student initiatives in the engineering
                community.

                <p>Outside of my life in engineering, I love watching movies and tv shows - especially the ones that
                    don’t get talked about a whole lot; shooting
                    professional & recreational photography in my free time; hiking, and aviation.

                <p>I began my journey in the Math department, earning myself a minor. Over time, I realized that

                </p>
                <p>When I'm not studying, I'm usually at the gym lifting weights or coaching Brazilian Jiu-jitsu.

                <p>I am a third year engineering student. I chose systems major because I love to create things that
                    could help people and make life easier for them. I joined ESSS because
                    it is very inclusive, supportive and fun. Through my role I hope to be able to attract more
                    students with different backgrounds to the community and bring everyone together.
                    I love to talk to new people and make new friends.
