Things to do to website at this moment:

- Add new team to website
- Revise Announcement Automation

- New CSS Stylesheet
  - Button Animations still need to be programmed in

Pages to Add:
- Error 404 (Done)
 - Add Professors to 404 Screen (?)
  - Mike S.
  - Craig

- Resources (Needs Decoration and Links to Fill in)
  - Event Resources
- Co-op
- Calendar
- Room Location
 - Status for Arcade and 3D Printer (?)

Fixes:
 - Fix redirection so user can actually go back and not take them to the page before entering the site
 - Announcements page is very rough, and needs security checks like making sure they don't spam the next/back button over and over
 - Shadows can be softened a bit More
 - Fix buttons at beginning so they can open page in new tab?
 - Make the learn more button actually do something at the top of the page
