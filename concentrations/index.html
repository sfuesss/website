        <p class="concentration-desc">This concentration focuses on the inner
            working of the computer, how transistors
            work and are used in computer
            architecture. You will learn hardware
            programming and how it connects
            with the software. You will have the
            opportunity to develop your software
            programming skills however it doesn’t
            specialise in that area like computer
            science. From the electives you have the
            option to learn about diverse topics, from
            web development to computer graphics
            and rendering. From what you choose to
            do in your coops, there is a high chance to
            develop some skills and fill in the gaps in
            academics, such as learning CAD and PCB
            design.

                <p>If you are not interested in the hardware
                    side of programming, best option is
                    Computer Science where the focus is on
                    software development and engineering.

        <p class="concentration-desc">The electronics concentration is fitted for
            students interested in electronics, analog
            circuitry, and telecommunications. It
            will develop an advanced knowledge of
            electrical theory, electromagnetics and
            vector calculus. If you like working with
            circuits in the lab, from key classes ENSC
            220: Electric Circuits I and ENSC 225:
            Microelectronics, then electronics may be
            the choice for you. There is also an optional
            honours program, which includes a thesis,
            that would be beneficial for students
            pursuing research and graduate studies.

                <p>This concentration will open doors to
                    careers like designing electronics and
                    consulting.

                <p>The focus is on electronics and not
                    power, which can limit your opportunties.
                    It is recommended to supplment your
                    technical skills with co-ops, design teams,
                    and personal projects.

        <p class="concentration-desc">Systems Engineering is the “kitchen sink”
            of engineering programs at SFU. You
            learn a little bit of electrical, computer,
            software, and hardware. It is also the only
            Engineering Science concentration that
            touches on mechanical engineering! By
            getting a more general degree and learning
            a portion of multiple concentrations, you
            can see the big-picture and bridge the gap
            between different project teams. Having
            a broad degree doesn’t limit you by your
            undergrad and you can specialize into an
            area once you’re in the work force. If you’re
            a “jack of all trades”, this concentration
            might be the one for you!

                <p>Project Management is a great place to
                    apply your varied knowledge in a variety
                    of topics. For more technical roles,
                    possibilities include product design,
                    manufacturing, robotics, and more!

                <p>Systems students also significantly benefit
                    from co-ops and design team experience
                    to build practical skills like CAD, P&ID, and
                    PCB design.

        <p class="concentration-desc">Biomedical Engineering at SFU focuses
            on electronic and medical devices
            in this broad and interdisciplinary
            field. By taking courses from the BPK
            department and elective courses that
            focus on the biomedical field, you will
            become familiarised and skilled in human
            physiology and medical devices. Your skills
            then can help patients and the medical
            industry to improve human life. With the
            co-op program, you will become trained
            anvd gain experience in this industry such
            as Kardium, and LivaNova. Towards the
            end of your undergrad degree, you will
            be doing a thesis that allows you to learn
            academic research and writing. This will
            prepare you for graduate school if you are
            interested in pursuing higher education.
